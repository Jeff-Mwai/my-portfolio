                    <h3>I am a software developer based in Nairobi, Kenya.</h3>

                <div class="about3">
                    <p class="about4">I was born and brought up in Juja, Central Kenya. I have two siblings who are also in school seeking for different career paths. Notably, I attended my primary school education in Juja and later joined a high school in Kirinyaga Country. This was beneficial in enabling me understand other cultures better. However, after secondary school education, I moved to Nairobi and, it is here, that I developed interest in programming. I saw the numerous challenges that people are facing in the society, and noticed that learning to code would help solve some of these problems. I am currently in Moringa School studying software development.</p>

                    <p class="about5">Thus, it means that my career in software development began this year, whereby I created basic HTML and CSS pages. I have continuously improved my skills, and I can now create very huge and responsive websites incorporating some Javascript basics. Although it is a tough professional path, I have gained passion in software development, since, in the long run, it is about solving societal problems. Currently, I enjoy turning complex problems to simple solutions. When I am not coding, I enjoy swimming, skating, eating pizza and travelling.I have the zeal and enthusiasm to keep pushing forward regardless of the challenges I face in life</p>
