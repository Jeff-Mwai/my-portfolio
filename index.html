            <div class="about3">
                <p class="about4">My career in software development began this year, whereby I created basic HTML and CSS pages. I have continuously improved my skills, and I can now create very huge and responsive websites. I have the zeal and enthusiasm to keep pushing forwards regardless of the challenges I face in life</p>
                <p class="about5">I was born and brought up in Juja, Central Kenya, whereby I attended school in different colleges. However, after school, I moved to Nairobi where my interest in programming grew.Although it is a tough professional path, I have gained passion in software development, since, in the long run, it is about solving societal problems. Currently, I enjoy turning complex problems to simple solutions. When I am not coding, I enjoy swimming, skating and travelling.</p>
